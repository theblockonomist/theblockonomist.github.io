[{"content":"A Brief History of Money The Earth provides us with everything we need to grow food, develop tools, make shelters and live our lives. It does so in the form of natural resources. However, these resources are not distributed uniformly and are limited in quantity. Numerous wars were fought in history to gain access to these resources. Trading is something that developed as an alternative to war overtime. Trading involved the exchange of resources in a dynamic, such that the participants from a region offered a resource that their region was rich in, in exchange for sparse resources. People initially bartered (exchanged) their resources directly. However, the barter system had numerous limitations. The direct exchange of two resources requires both the parties to be wanting to get the other resource. Another problem can be a resource being indivisible. For example, if a cow is worth four sheep, it would be problematic for a person processing only cows to buy exactly two sheep. Most importantly, there was no way of storing value. Overtime people developed the concept of money. So what is money? Money essentially is a tool to move value across space and time. It must satisfy the properties of:\nDivisibility (The ability to be divisible into smaller units) Portability (The ability to move across space) Durability (The ability to survive wear and tear for long periods) Recognizability (The ability of being identified easily) Scarcity (Explained ahead in the Article ) \\\nHistorically, Monetary Metals satisfied most of these properties, with gold being the most scarce one of them all. Scarcity essentially means that the demand of an asset outstrips its supply. The scarcity of a metal depends on how difficult it is to mine and extract it. A scarce metal is more inflation resistant. Inflation is the decline of the value of an asset with time, caused by its increased supply. So if a metal is easily extractable, it would mean that the metal would have a high supply, resulting in a lower demand overtime, resulting in it losing value with time. The market always favors that form of money, which is inflation resistant. This is because inflation decreases the value of an asset, which is like being robbed off value, by time itself (will be explained in the next article). Gold was very scarce and, additionally, a chemically inert metal, which implied that it didn’t change its chemical composition or lose its luster with time. Also, because of being highly malleable, it was very easy to forge coins out of it. This was the reason gold was used as currency in all the great civilizations of the past. Gold could essentially hold value with time, because it wasn’t possible to artificially inflate the value of gold, due to it being limited in supply. However, the problem with gold was that although it is great at holding value across time, it’s very difficult to move it across space. This is because gold is very heavy to move, and also very expensive to secure. This inherently leads to being an obstacle to our goal of globalizing society. In order to solve the Portability problem of gold, governments introduced “paper currency”, something that comes to our mind when we hear the word “money” today (unlike around 200 years back). When the United States of America introduced The Dollar as its currency of exchange, they directly linked its value to gold. In other words, they fixed the value of gold to a certain amount of dollars. For Example if they fixed the price of gold at $1000 a kilogram, the value of the dollar would become precisely equal to the value of 1 gram of gold (which is 1/1000th of a kilogram). This meant that if a person gave a $100 bill to the Central Bank, The Central Bank would have to give him $100 worth of Gold (which is 100 grams of Gold). So a dollar bill was essentially a promise to the Bearer of the bill that the government owed him gold, worth the amount written on the bill. This monetary system, under which the country’s currency is fixed and may be freely convertible into gold, is called “The Gold Standard”. This solved the ‘portability problem’ of gold, because now people could easily move dollar bills from one location in the country to another location, because a dollar bill is fundamentally a compact and light piece of paper. Value of Gold weighing hundreds of kilograms could now be moved across space in compact briefcases weighing less than a kilo. Although this was a feasible solution, it introduced a new problem, a problem of ‘trust’, which will be the subject of the next article.\n","permalink":"https://theblockonomist.github.io/posts/abriefhistoryofmoney/","summary":"A Brief History of Money The Earth provides us with everything we need to grow food, develop tools, make shelters and live our lives.
